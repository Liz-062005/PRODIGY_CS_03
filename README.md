Password Checker Complexity



	12th July: Understood the task and researched password strength rules like length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Decided to use Python in Google Colab.
	13th July: Created a new Colab notebook and started coding. Added checks for length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
	14th July: Added scoring system to classify passwords as Weak, Moderate, or Strong. Wrote feedback messages based on missing criteria.
	15th July: Tested different types of passwords and fixed any issues. Made sure feedback matched the passwordâ€™s actual strength.
	16th July: Planned to improve output with better formatting. Also aimed to clean the code and handle edge cases.
	17th July: Planned to finalize the notebook, export it as PDF, and upload both to a new GitHub repo with a proper README.
